In the Lenin Barracks in Barcelona, the day before I joined the militia, I saw an Italian militiaman standing in front of the officers’ table. 

He was a tough-looking youth of twenty-five or six, with reddish-yellow hair and powerful shoulders. His peaked leather cap was pulled fiercely over one eye. 
He was standing in profile to me, his chin on his breast, gazing with a puzzled frown at a map which one of the officers had open on the table. Something in his face deeply moved me. It was the face of a man who would commit murder and throw away his life for a friend–the kind of face you would expect in an Anarchist, though as likely as not he was a Communist. There were both candour and ferocity in it; also the pathetic reverence that illiterate people have for their supposed superiors. Obviously he could not make head or tail of the map; obviously he regarded mapreading as a stupendous intellectual feat. 
I hardly know why, but I have seldom seen anyone–any man, I mean–to whom I have taken such an immediate liking. 
While they were talking round the table some remark brought it out that I was a foreigner. The Italian raised his head and said quickly: 

’Italiano?’ 
I answered in my bad Spanish: ’No, Inglés. Y tú?’
’Italiano.’ 

As we went out he stepped across the room and gripped my hand very hard. Queer, the affection you can feel for a stranger! 
It was as though his spirit and mine had momentarily succeeded in bridging the gulf of language and tradition and meeting in utter intimacy.
I hoped he liked me as well as I liked him. 
But I also knew that to retain my first impression of him I must not see him again; and needless to say I never did see him again. 
One was always making contacts of that kind in Spain.
